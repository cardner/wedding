    <h3 class="bold">Zola: Honeymoon Registry &amp; Group Gifts</h3>
    <p>We want to start our marriage off with some fun time away from the daily grind -- in Barcelona! We've registered for experiences that we'd love to have there -- bingeing on tapas and paella, visiting the Salvador Dali museum, cycling the surrounding wine region. We hope that these are moments we'll look back on fifty years from now.</p>

    <h3 class="bold">MyRegistry: Items to Fill Our Home</h3>
    <p>We are grateful to live very comfortably in a wonderful home. We've registered for some items that would make that even better, like cocktail glasses for our dinner parties and 2+ player board games that'll keep us entertained through long Michigan winters.</p>
