  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Ryan and Cory met in August 2013, on a date at The Olde German, a bar that it turns out neither liked. In the first few months, they bonded over cycling, cocktails, food, and beer. Ryan wowed Cory with his baked spaghetti and willingness to work on her bike for free. Cory impressed him with [her sluttiness? constant grammar corrections? not being disgusted by dog vomit?].....</p>
  <p> Their first relationship test was the pets: Ryan's dog Ralph and Cory's cat Leloo. Ryan, never fond of cats, quickly became Leloo's favorite person, while Cory won Ralph's affection by letting him crawl all over her. By the summer of 2014, the pets were warming up to each other in Ryan and Cory's new house and welcoming another dog, Zelda.</p>
  <p> When Ryan's habit of getting up first and waking her with coffee continued for months after moving in together, Cory knew she had to "lock that sh*t down." The couple decided to get married sometime in the fall of 2014, but nobody can remember exactly when.</p>
  <p> These days, Cory still appreciates the coffee in the morning, but she's also grateful for Ryan's calm demeanor and steadiness to ground her when she's stressed. They still love cycling, cooking, eating, and boozing together, but they also spend a lot of evenings just cuddling with all their furry babies on the couch. They're so excited celebrate the next chapter of their relationship, together with their loved ones, at their wedding in January 2016.</p>
